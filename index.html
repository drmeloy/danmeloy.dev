    <p class='greeting'>Hello! My name is Dan. I'm a full-stack software engineer. I'm passionate about combining technical skill and interpersonal connections to create beautiful and innovative digital products. I believe that meaningful relationships lead to positive results. As such, I seek to invest in people as much as in the technologies we use.</p>

    <p>A bit about me...</p>
    <p>My unusual background has provided me a range of experiences that help shape who I am. As a student of Anthropology I learned how perspectives vary and hugely differentiate the way we understand the world around us. Throughout my life I strive to keep a perspectives based approach to problem solving and relationship building, believing that the first step to success is understanding others as best we can.</p>
    <p>I've opened two successful businesses abroad in Quito, Ecuador. Being a co-owner and founder of Community Hostel and Bandido Brewing taught me how to take ideas and turn them into reality. The challenges of opening two businesses in a foreign country taught me the value of adaptability. With a mindset of adaptability, any problem is solvable, any issue or interruption is merely a part of the process. To this day my adaptability remains one of my greatest strengths.</p>
