    <p class='greeting'>Hello! My name is Dan. I'm a full-stack software engineer. I'm passionate about combining technical skill and interpersonal connections to create beautiful and innovative digital products. I believe that meaningful relationships lead to positive results. As such, I seek to invest in people as much as in the technologies we use.</p>

  <section id='about'>
    <p class='title'>A bit about my background...</p>
    <div class='backgrounds'>
    <p class='background'>My life has provided me with a range of experiences that help shape who I am. As a student of Anthropology, I learned how perspectives often vary and hugely differentiate the way we understand the world. Throughout my life I strive to keep a perspectives-based approach to problem solving and relationship building, believing that the first step to success is understanding others as best we can.</p>
    <p class='background'>I've opened two successful businesses abroad in Quito, Ecuador. Being a co-owner and founder of <a href='https://communityhostel.com/' target='_blank'>Community Hostel</a> and <a href='http://bandidobrewing.com/en/' target='_blank'>Bandido Brewing</a> taught me how to take ideas and turn them into reality. The challenges of opening two businesses in a foreign country taught me the value of adaptability. With a mindset of adaptability, any problem is solvable, any issue or interruption is merely a part of the process. To this day my adaptability remains one of my greatest strengths.</p>
    <p class='background'>I've been a leader and facilitator for a wilderness non-profit. I led backcountry wilderness trips for adults with physical and developmental disabilities and facilitated outdoor experiential education events for under-served student communities. By helping people connect with the outdoors I was helping them build their confidence and realize that they can do anything they set their minds to, regardless of personal background or ability level.</p>
    </div>
    <p class='ender'>Now, as a developer and engineer, I hope to use technology to apply the lessons I've learned throughout my life. I aim to solve problems that can empower others.</p>
